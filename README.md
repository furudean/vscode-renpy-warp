# Ren'Py Launch and Sync

Launch and sync your Ren'Py game at the current line directly from inside Visual
Studio Code.

## Features

-   Start and quit your Ren'Py game directly from Visual Studio Code
-   Warp games to a specific line, or jump to a label
-   Move cursor position in Visual Studio Code as dialogue progresses with the
    _Follow Cursor_ mode
-   A gutter decoration to remind you where you are in the game, even when the
    cursor moves away
-   Automatically enable autoreload when files change (with a setting)
-   Can discover and bind to games that were started outside of Visual Studio
    Code
-   Can manage installs of the Ren'Py SDK directly from Visual Studio Code

## Commands

The extension provides many commands to interact with Ren'Py. You probably want
to know about the following:

| Command                         | Shortcut                                      | Shortcut (Mac)                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Start Ren'Py project            | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd>  | <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> |
| Open Ren'Py at the current line | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>  | <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> |
| Open Ren'Py at label            | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd>  | <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> |
| Go to current Ren'Py line       | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> | <kbd>⌥</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> |
| Toggle following cursor mode    | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>  | <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> |

### Triggers

The commands can be triggered in several ways:

1. By using title bar run menu ![](images/tab_bar.png)
2. By using the right click context in an editor ![](images/editor_context.png)
3. By using the right click context menu in the file explorer
   ![](images/explorer_context.png)
4. By using the status bar ![](images/status_bar.png)
5. By opening the command palette and typing the command, i.e.
   `Renpy: Open Ren'Py at current line`
6. Via keyboard shortcut ([see here](#commands))

## Configuration

You must set <code codesetting="renpyWarp.sdkPath">renpyWarp.sdkPath</code> to a
directory where the Ren'Py SDK can be found. If you haven't done so, a prompt
will appear to inform you to set it.

### Strategy

You may want to customize what to do with an open Ren'Py instance when a new
command is issued. In Renpy Launch and Sync, this is called a "strategy".

The strategy is controlled with the setting
<code codesetting="renpyWarp.strategy">renpyWarp.strategy</code>, which can be
set to one of the following values:

<dl>
   <dt><strong>Update Window</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <p>
         When a command is issued, replace an open editor by sending a
         <code>renpy.warp_to_line()</code> command to the currently running 
         Ren'Py instance
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>New window</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      Open a new Ren'Py instance when a command is issued
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Replace window</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      Kill the currently running Ren'Py instance and open a new one when a 
      command is issued
   </dd>
</dl>

### Follow Cursor

Renpy Launch and Sync can keep its cursor in sync with the Ren'Py game. The
direction of this sync can be controlled with the setting
<code codesetting="renpyWarp.followCursorMode">renpyWarp.followCursorMode</code>

<dl>
   <dt><strong>Ren'Py updates Visual Studio Code</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      The editor will move its cursor to match the current line of dialogue in 
      the game.
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Visual Studio Code updates Ren'Py</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      Ren'Py will warp to the line being edited. Your game must be compatible
      with warping for this to work correctly.
   </dd>
   <dt><strong>Update both</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      Try and keep both in sync with each other. Because of how warping works, 
      this can be a bit janky, causing a feedback loop.
   </dd>
</dl>

Cursor syncing can be turned on by default with the setting <code codesetting="renpyWarp.followCursorOnLaunch">renpyWarp.followCursorOnLaunch</code>.

### Focus Window on Warp

When a warp occurs, you may want the Ren'Py window to be focused. This can be
configured with the setting
<code codesetting="renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp">renpyWarp.focusWindowOnWarp</code>.

You might be prompted to allow Visual Studio Code to control other applications
when this setting is enabled. After allowing this, restart Visual Studio Code to
apply the changes.

## Version support

Ren'Py 8.2+ is fully supported.

Ren'Py 8.1 and earlier does not support RPE features.

## Troubleshooting

In order to use the current line/file feature, your game must be compatible with
warping as described in
[the Ren'Py documentation](https://www.renpy.org/doc/html/developer_tools.html#warping-to-a-line).
This feature has several limitations that you should be aware of, and as such
may not work in all cases.
